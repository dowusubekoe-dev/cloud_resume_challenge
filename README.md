# Cloud Resume Challenge

A cloud-native resume website built using Next.js, React, and TailwindCSS, deployed on AWS. This project was completed as part of the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/).

## Project Overview

This project implements a full-stack resume website with the following features:
- Frontend built with Next.js and TailwindCSS
- Backend API using AWS Lambda and API Gateway
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Visitor counter using DynamoDB
- SSL/TLS certification and custom domain setup

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Cloud architecture design and implementation
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles using Terraform
- CI/CD pipeline setup and automation
- Serverless computing with AWS Lambda
- API development and integration
- Cloud security best practices
- DNS configuration and SSL/TLS certification
- Cost optimization in cloud services

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Challenge: Managing complex AWS infrastructure
   - Solution: Utilized Terraform for reproducible infrastructure deployment

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Challenge: Automating deployment process
   - Solution: Implemented GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

3. **Security**
   - Challenge: Securing cloud resources and API endpoints
   - Solution: Implemented IAM roles, API Gateway authentication, and security best practices
